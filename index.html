			<h2>Cameras</h2>
			<p><code>The cameras often serving a public interest, aren't connected to public networks. These sensors vary from monitoring vehicular traffic to recording water usage. Surveillance cameras are perhaps one of the more noticeable--and contested--forms of networked objects in public space. The public "connects" to surveillance networks all the time, albeit involuntarily, here offers a view into who controls some of the ubiquitous networks.</code></p>

			<h2>Antennas</h2>
			<p><code>Tracking things on the ground can sometimes be tricky--markings and manhole covers get worn down and faded, they're sometimes in the middle of the road, and it's easy to bump into things when looking down all the time. Here are some other objects that indicate pieces of the network.</code></p>

			<h3>Carpark Cameras</h3>
				<p>These white signal control boxes attached to traffic signal posts are just one piece of a massive system of networked objects. The system, designed by the North Carolina-based transit services company TransitScore, combines data collected by real-time traffic cameras, RFID (radio frequency identification) scanners, and other field sensors to create traffic signal times that adapt to the immediate conditions of traffic. Each signal control box contains wireless routing equipment and traffic controllers that connect back to a fiber hub. The little green dome on top of the signal control is actually a powerful wireless router used for communicating with the other sensors in the traffic network and the city’s Traffic Management Center in Wellington City.</p>

			<h3>Distributed Antenna Systems</h3>
				<p>A Distributed Antenna System (DAS) is basically a way to expand a cell network's reach, adding capacity in under-covered areas. They're a little easier to find on the street because they're not on top of buildings--they're attached to street poles and linked to underground fiber-optic networks.</p>

			<h3>Cell Towers</h3>
				<p>If you're connecting to the internet when you're out in the world, you're probably connecting to a cellular wireless network. Seeing the internet on the street, for many, just means using a smartphone. Those phones connect to networks via cell towers. Generally, these are pretty hard to see from the street--they're mostly on tops of buildings. They're also often disguised, although their New York disguises (bricks on buildings) are pretty simple compared to cell tower disguises in other places (trees, church crosses, cacti).</p>

			<h2>Street Markings</h2>
			<p><code>Sometimes you'll see a manhole cover that is surrounded with colorful markings. Whenever a contractor or construction company plans to do street excavation, utility companies will mark out the location of their underground cables so that the contractor knows to watch out for them.This means that orange lines can be internet cables, television cables, telephone lines, or other kinds of conduits. The markings are sometimes really sloppy, and often in fragments. Sometimes you'll see several different labels in the same place. A lot of these cables are bundled up together running through ducts under the city.</code></p>
